But, a few cocktails later, they decided to take six months off and travel the globe. Acting upon the plan, they have travelled across the world since 2014 quitting their high-profile jobs to soak in diverse cultures and savour a variety of cuisines and drinks. Both were seeking a sense of adventure and a better work/life balance and as they candidly put, they could give up everything to do this. So they did...and have travelled to more than 90 destinations since 2014 and gone trekking through the rainforests of Malaysia and on a, Icelandic glacier; explored the deserts of UAE and even swum with turtles in the Maldives. This nomadic couple has documented their explorations through Sweden, Denmark, and the Czech Republic on our platform as well.</p>

Since then, it was no looking back and now Meg endeavours to inspire others to have adventures in daily life, just like them as they travel through Peru, Europe, South and North America, Asia, etc. The LGBT community though, faces difficulties and safety issues in many countries and so, the duo attempt to lead by example and inspire the community to explore the world fearlessly.
